DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND RESEARCH

OFFICIAL SANCTION #020951

Dear Dr Stella,

After having received and reviewed your file submission, we are pleased to report that your research has been approved and officially sanctioned by the DHR.

Attached is a personal note from [SEN. LEON MATHEWS]:

Look Stella, I'm not going to pretend everyone's all comfortable with you again, but someone needs to study this damn rock so it may as well be you.
If that thing's anywhere near as durable or outputs anywhere near as much energy as you claim, Defence wants it.
You've got eyes on you.

SEN. LEON MATHEWS
