RESEARCH LOG #87

One by one, they start to hear its voice.
They start to preach His word.
They let go of their bodies, then their minds.
Their bones melt and seep into their flesh, until they become amorphous blobs of pussing matter.

Those of us who remain will dedicate ourselves to this.
However many more of us that succumb, we will find a way.
We have to.
